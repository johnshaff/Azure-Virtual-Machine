the create the azure gallery application section produces a resource called:

apache2 (linuxAppGallery/apache2) 

of type VM application definition. 

when I run add app blob to gallery application section, a resource called:



In Azure, when working with Azure Compute Gallery applications, creating the application itself is a separate step from creating the versions of the application. Here’s the breakdown of why it works this way:

	1.	Gallery Application Creation: You first create the application, which acts as a container or placeholder for different versions of the application. At this stage, you are not defining the actual package or content of the application.
    
	2.	Version Creation: After the application is created, you create versions for it. The first version (or any subsequent version) is where you specify the actual package or content (such as the location of the application files). Versions allow you to handle updates and versioning separately while maintaining the same gallery application.

This design is intentional because it separates the logical entity (the application) from the physical content (the version and its package). It gives you flexibility to update or roll back to different versions without changing the core application definition.


You’re absolutely right to find it a bit confusing. The reason you have to allow public access at the storage account level, even when using the -Permission parameter for blobs or containers, stems from how Azure manages security for storage accounts. Let me break it down:

	1.	Storage Account-Level Public Access Control:
Azure gives you the ability to manage public access at the storage account level. This allows you to enforce a security policy across all containers and blobs in that account. If public access is disabled at this level, no containers or blobs can have public access, even if you specify it at the container level using the -Permission parameter.
	2.	Container/Blob-Level Public Access Control:
The -Permission parameter (with values like Blob or Container) is used to manage the scope of public access once the storage account allows public access. The key difference is:
	•	Blob permission allows anonymous read access to the blobs in the container, but not the container metadata itself.
	•	Container permission allows anonymous access to both blobs and the container metadata.
	3.	Why the Two Layers of Control?:
The storage account-level setting is meant to provide a security boundary to prevent accidental public exposure of data. Even if someone tries to enable public access on a container, the account-wide policy will override it unless explicitly allowed. This adds an extra layer of protection for organizations that prioritize security and want to ensure no containers are accidentally made public.

In Summary:

	•	Storage Account-Level: Enables or disables public access for the entire account.
	•	Container/Blob-Level: Controls how granular the public access is (blob-level or container-level) once the storage account allows public access.

So, you need to allow public access at the storage account level first, and then the -Permission parameter can take effect at the container level. Without enabling it at the account level, the container-level settings won’t work.
